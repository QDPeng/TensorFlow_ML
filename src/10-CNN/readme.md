## [Ch 8: Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/nfmcclure/tensorflow_cookbook/tree/master/08_Convolutional_Neural_Networks)

 1. [Introduction](https://github.com/nfmcclure/tensorflow_cookbook/tree/master/08_Convolutional_Neural_Networks/01_Intro_to_CNN)
  * We introduce convolutional neural networks (CNN), and how we can use them in Tensorflow.
 2. [Implementing a Simple CNN.](https://github.com/nfmcclure/tensorflow_cookbook/tree/master/08_Convolutional_Neural_Networks/02_Intro_to_CNN_MNIST)
  * Here, we show how to create a CNN architecture that performs well on the MNIST digit recognition task.
 3. [Implementing an Advanced CNN.](https://github.com/nfmcclure/tensorflow_cookbook/tree/master/08_Convolutional_Neural_Networks/03_CNN_CIFAR10)
  * In this example, we show how to replicate an architecture for the CIFAR-10 image recognition task.
 4. [Retraining an Existing Architecture.](https://github.com/nfmcclure/tensorflow_cookbook/tree/master/08_Convolutional_Neural_Networks/04_Retraining_Current_Architectures)
  * We show how to download and setup the CIFAR-10 data for the [Tensorflow retraining/fine-tuning tutorial.](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/inception)
 5. [Using Stylenet/NeuralStyle.](https://github.com/nfmcclure/tensorflow_cookbook/tree/master/08_Convolutional_Neural_Networks/05_Stylenet_NeuralStyle)
  * In this recipe, we show a basic implementation of using Stylenet or Neuralstyle.
 6. [Implementing Deep Dream.](https://github.com/nfmcclure/tensorflow_cookbook/tree/master/08_Convolutional_Neural_Networks/06_Deepdream)
  * This script shows a line-by-line explanation of Tensorflow's deepdream tutorial. Taken from [Deepdream on Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/deepdream). Note that the code here is converted to Python 3.
