Deepdream in Tensorflow
=======================

Note: There is no new code in this script.  It originates from the Tensorflow tutorial [located here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/deepdream).  However, this code is modified slightly to run on Python 3.  The code is also commented very heavily to explain, line-by-line, what occurs in the deepdream demo.

Here are some potential outputs.

> Deepdream results on four features with the book's cover image.

Our interpretation so far:
 * Feature #50: feathers
 * Feature #110: Shells or scales
 * Feature #100: Swirly eyeballs
 * Feature #139: Flowers (this one is from TF tutorial)
