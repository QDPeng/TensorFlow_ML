## [Ch 10:Taking Tensorflow to Production](https://github.com/nfmcclure/tensorflow_cookbook/tree/master/10_Taking_Tensorflow_to_Production)

 1. [Implementing Unit Tests](https://github.com/nfmcclure/tensorflow_cookbook/tree/master/10_Taking_Tensorflow_to_Production/01_Implementing_Unit_Tests)
  * We show how to implement different types of unit tests on tensors (placeholders and variables).
 2. [Using Multiple Executors (Devices)](https://github.com/nfmcclure/tensorflow_cookbook/tree/master/10_Taking_Tensorflow_to_Production/02_Using_Multiple_Devices)
  * How to use a machine with multiple devices.  E.g., a machine with a CPU, and one or more GPUs.
 3. [Parallelizing Tensorflow](https://github.com/nfmcclure/tensorflow_cookbook/tree/master/10_Taking_Tensorflow_to_Production/03_Parallelizing_Tensorflow)
  * How to setup and use Tensorflow distributed on multiple machines.
 4. [Tips for Tensorflow in Production](https://github.com/nfmcclure/tensorflow_cookbook/tree/master/10_Taking_Tensorflow_to_Production/04_Production_Tips)
  * Various tips for devloping with Tensorflow
 5. [An Example of Productionalizing Tensorflow](https://github.com/nfmcclure/tensorflow_cookbook/tree/master/10_Taking_Tensorflow_to_Production/05_Production_Example)
  * We show how to do take the RNN model for predicting ham/spam (from Chapter 9, recipe #2) and put it in two production level files: training and evaluation.
